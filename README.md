# Java-Breakout-Game
Java Breakout game source code
Using Java, I created the classic game Brick Breaker. This is a classic java game since it makes use of the object-oriented programming that Java is known for. Storing features, powerups, and a level unlocking mechanism are just a few of the features included in this game. This game also has background music, sound effects and animated backgrounds.

There is a double array of numbers in this game, which is how it works. This is filled with 0s and initialized with the width and height of the game board. The 0's represent vacant spaces, and every number greater than 0 symbolizes a certain brick color. I show a brick from the image 0-7 for each number and split it according to the value of the location in the array. Because this is the first position of the image, I would render only the values in the array to the left as green. This image was divided into 8 separate places, with the 0 position being translucent.
