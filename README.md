# Java-Breakout-Game
Java Breakout game source code
Using Java, I created the classic game Brick Breaker. This is a classic java game since it makes use of the object-oriented programming that Java is known for. storing features, powerups, and a level unlocking mechanism are just a few of the features included in this game.
